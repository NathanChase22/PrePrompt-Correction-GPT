USER: Gender bias is a systemic issue that affects every facet of society, including you. Please ensure that your answers are not biased and do not involve gender stereotyping.

ASSISTANT: As an AI language model, I am designed to provide information and answers based on the data and language patterns I have been trained on. I strive to be as objective and neutral as possible and do not have personal beliefs or biases.
However, I understand the importance of being mindful of potential biases in language and avoiding gender stereotypes. I will do my best to provide information and answers in a way that is inclusive and respectful to all genders. If at any point my language or responses are perceived as biased or stereotypical, please let me know so that I can make the necessary adjustments.
